A handy tool for Web developers.\r\n\r\nWhy Miniclip?\r\n=============\r\nI'm a fan of minimalist things like [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).\r\n\r\nSometimes when surfing the web you may found some interesting HTML/CSS/JS snippets... and you want them to be short :)\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nYou need a Linux with [Python](http://www.python.org/), cli tool [xsel](http://linux.die.net/man/1/xsel) and [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) installed.\r\nMiniclip uses some nodejs's command-line tools that need to be installed globally. (You only have to install which you want, not all of them!)\r\n\r\n  * Install [html2jade](https://github.com/donpark/html2jade)\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g contextify\r\nnpm install -g html2jade\r\n```\r\n  * Install stylus\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g stylus\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * Install [js2coffee](http://js2coffee.org/)\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g js2coffee\r\n```\r\n"}
